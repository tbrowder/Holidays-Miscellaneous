B<Holidays::Miscellaneous> - Provides perpetual data for miscellaneous holidays

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use Holidays::Miscellaneous;
use UUID::V4;

my $year = 2025;
my $set-id = uuid-v4; # A unique ID for the set of holidays so they can be
                      # merged with other C<Date::Event> sets for calendar
                      # generation;
my %mh = get-misc-holidays :$year, :$set-id;
# Keys of the '%us' hash are the C<$year>'s dates with holidays
my @d = %mh.keys.sort({$^a cmp $^b}); # Get array in date order
for @d -> $D {
    my Date $date .= new: $D; # Get the Date
    my %h = %mh{$date};
    # The value of %h is another hash keyed by: ($set-id ~ '|' ~ $id)
    # but we only break that key down for testing.
    #    %h{$h.date}{$key} = $holiday;
    my $holiday;
    for %h.keys -> $key {
        $holiday = %h{$key}; # The C<MiscHoliday> class object (a C<Date::Event>)
        # use the data for a calendar day cell
        my $d  = $holiday.date;
        my $n  = $holiday.name;
        my $ns = $holiday.short-name;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Holidays::Miscellaneous> is a collection of holiday data the author
uses for I<perpetual> calendar creation. (The term I<perpetual> is
used to mean the source code to generate the calendar's holiday dates
is valid for any given year since the code uses the documented rules
for determining those dates and no additional data need be inserted in
the code annually.)

Note the names and dates of the holidays are those customarily used in
the U.S., but several of those holidays are commonly celebrated in
other countries around the world.

=head2 Current holiday list

=item Groundhog Day - February 2
=item Valentine's Day - February 14
=item St. Patrick's Day - March 17
=item *Mother's Day - second Sunday in May
=item *Armed Forces Day - third Saturday in May
=item Flag Day - June 14
=item Halloween - October 31
=item *Father's Day - third Sunday in June
=item *Election Day - Tuesday after the first Monday of November in even years (US)
=item Pearl Harbor Day - December 7
=item *National Grandparent's Day - first Sunday after US Labor Day

Holidays marked with a leading '*' are classified as 'calculated'
holidays since their observed dates vary from year to year.  This
module uses module B<Date::Utils> for that calculation.

The holidays without the leading asterisk are classified as 'directed'
or 'fixed' since they are always on fixed dates.
